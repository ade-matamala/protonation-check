# protonation-check
This is a script for checking the protonation states of a given PDB file. 
It does so by reading each atom line from ionizable residues and checking if the proton is present or not. 
Probably it can be improved a lot and I have not tried running it with other structures that weren't the main one. 
So there's a lot of work to do, that maybe I will do in the future. 
Please, feel free to improve it or reach me.
